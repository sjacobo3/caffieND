	<p>Our application is a caffeinated beverage suggester, CAFFEINATE, perfect for the college student that wants to spice up their usual caffeine fix. We want to take a range of data about caffeinated beverages including caffeine amount (mg), flavors, type of drink (coffee, tea, energy drink, etc). Users can search for recommendations based on how much caffeine they would like/scale of 1-5 how tired they are, flavors they like, and categories like hot vs cold, tea vs coffee vs energy drinks.</p>

	<p>Our application is very useful to anyone that is addicted to caffeine and wants to switch up their usual order. It can be difficult to find a new drink to satisfy your caffeine cravings, flavor preferences, etc. This app will make it significantly easier to curb your cravings in the most enjoyable way. The closest app to ours would be an online menu, showing statistics about beverages for specific brands. However, there is no app with a wide range of brands/drinks to choose from or get recommendations from, with the exception of asking generative AI.</p>
	<p>Our data will come from datasets online from Kaggle and USDA. Our data contains information on caffeine levels and other nutrients on various caffeinated beverages. We will also gather a dataset on body weight and caffeine level intake to be able to make recommendations of drinks.</p>

	<p>Our application will allow users to query and search for specific drinks to get that information on whichever one they want. If they donâ€™t see a certain drink in the list, they can add it including the caffeine levels and other information. We will probably not use a delete function.</p>

	<p>For our advanced application, we will enable user interaction to ask for recommendations on caffeinated beverages. Users can search for recommendations based on how much caffeine they would like, or they can base it on a scale of 1-5 how tired they are which will directly correlate to a caffeine range, flavors they like, and categories like hot vs cold, tea vs coffee vs energy drinks. After their input, we will also result in offering a couple of similar drinks / similar caffeine levels of different drinks within a brand.This will combine our dataset with the caffeine levels and body weight with our dataset on caffeine level of specific drinks. Our second one will ask the users for a rating, and this will contribute to an overall leader board on most popular drinks.</p>
